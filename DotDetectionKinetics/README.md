This repo contains scripts that are used to process gaussian fits to fluorescent dots obtained during microscopy and detected with the image processing pipeline of the ElfLab. The pipeline output contains the dots detected in each postition, the time point that the image has been recorded, the intensity of the dot as well as the sigma of the gaussian fit. These parameters are used to sort out false-positives.

The repo also contains a jupyter notebook for plotting of the detected spots and processing data obtained in different experiments.
