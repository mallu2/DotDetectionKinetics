----------------------------
Example parameter file for the ImAnalysis pipeline.

CheckDotDetectionParams.ipynb
-----------------------------
Script that is used to process gaussian fits to fluorescent dots obtained during microscopy and detected with the image processing pipeline of the ElfLab. The pipeline output contains the dots detected in each postition, the time point that the image has been recorded, the intensity of the dot as well as the sigma of the gaussian fit. It also contains the number of cells segmented in each position to calculate the average number of redorded dots per cell.

CheckDotDetectionParams.ipynb
-----------------------------
Jupyter notebook for plotting of the detected spots and processing data obtained in different experiments.
